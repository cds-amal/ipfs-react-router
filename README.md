> Better routing for IPFS websites using React Router

An alternative in `React Router` to the `BrowserRouter` or `HashRouter` that sets the basename dependent on how the site is being served over IPFS.

A site using the `IPFSRouter` can be served with working routing from all of the following:

- http://www.example.com
- http://www.example.com/ipfs/QmPm8NcEnpjRHmJEciWUv1nV2tBgTb74zgDhkvcxWkjh21/
- http://www.example.com/ipns/another.example.com/
